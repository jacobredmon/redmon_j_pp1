This project is my solution to a programming project in CS322 - Compiler Construction.
Application.java reads through the auth.log file and calls PatternMatching.java to parse 
through the lines and add unique IP addresses and usernames to their respective HashMaps.
build.xml is an ANT file which supports usage, clean, build, and run functions.
